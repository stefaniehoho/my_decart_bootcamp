MRI:On diffusion-weighted images there is a small area of 
restricted diffusion along the falx within the left 
occipitotemporal lobe. It is also bright on FLAIR-weighted 
images and may represent a subacute infarct. Clinical 
correlation is recommended. On gradient echo images there is a 
large area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right 
parietal lobe and left thalamus which following administration 
of gadolinium reveals ring-enhancing lesions. These are 
suspicious for hemorrhagic metastases given the patient's 
history. Additional ring-enhancing lesions throughout the supra- 
and infratentorial compartments are visualized. There is a 
moderate amount of peritumoral edema involving the right 
parietal lobe lesion in addition to a second right parietal 
lesion along the falx high in the vertex. The other areas of 
metastases reveal a minimal amount of peritumoral edema.
.
cxr: Cardiomegaly and mild CHF. Nasogastric tube as described 
above. Rounded opacity overlying the left hilum, which probably 
representing aspiration pneumonia; however, left hilar mass 
cannot be totally excluded. Please confirm resolution by 
repeated chest x-ray after treatment, and if the lesion 
persists, please evaluate by CT scan.
. 
ct: Stable appearance of right parietal lobe and left thalamic 
hemorrhages, which are concerning for hemorrhagic metastasis in 
this patient with known metastatic lung carcinoma to the brain.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo f s/p INH in R parietal region, evidence of UGIB, 
transferred to medicine, w/ pupillary assymmetry but no evidence 
of neglect, responding to commands.
.
1) altered MS- likely bleed into metastatic lesion, although 
unclear based on location of known lesions, vs component of 
fall.  as per NS, not a surgical candidate.  seems unlikely that 
pt will have dramatic cliical improvement given significant 
edema, mass lesions, and no NS intervention.
-palliative XRT? family mtg tonite to discuss utility. 
-cont dilantin px, particularly since pt has ? of witnessed sz 
event.
-cont high dose decadron, q6h w/ fs.
-will clarify 
.
2) GIB- drop in hct during admission and + NGL.  GI input 
appreciated felt likely [**1-24**] stress ulceration.  Enteral 
nutrition and PPI (usually oral) have been shown to reduce the 
risk of ongoing bleeding. 
-start TF's 10cc/h until nutrition recs
-IV protonix (given recent h/o GIB)
.
3) CAD/CHF- previously some CHF on CXR.  oxygenating well.  
euvolemic on exam despite significant anasarca of hands/feet- 
minimal swelling of tibial surfaces so partially related to 
restraints.   
-cont lopresser
-d/c lipitor, rx for hepatic dz.
.
4) fen- ivf, tf's

5) ppx- ppi, pneumoboots

6) code- dnr/dni

On [**2644-1-19**] a family meeting was held with Oncology, Social Work, 
Palliative Care Consult and primary medical team. At that time 
the family decided to place comfort as the main goal of her 
medical care. Her status was changed to "CMO".
