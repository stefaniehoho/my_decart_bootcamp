     CT-GUIDED BIOPSY OF RIGHT PLEURAL LESION
     
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Unable to tap right-sided effusion on ultrasound, please
     perform a thoracentesis via CT.
     
     PRE-PROCEDURE CT FINDINGS:  Pre-contrast CT of the chest was performed prior
     to thoracentesis.  There is a dependent left-sided pleural effusion.  There is
     high-density crescentic material present in the peripheral right hemithorax.
     It does not layer when the patient is repositioned.  A small right pleural
     effusion is also present.  There is coronary artery disease.  A central venous
     catheter is present with its tip in the right atrium.  There is no pericardial
     effusion.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  The lung windows demonstrate right-
     sided volume loss.  Motion artifact limits sensitivity for small nodules.  The
     airways are clear.
     
     Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or blastic lesions.  There is a nonfused
     fracture of the left fifth rib.  Similar-appearing fractures are present in
     the left sixth and seventh ribs.
     
     Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen demonstrates cholelithiasis.
     
     CT-GUIDED BIOPSY:  The advantages and complications of the procedure were
     explained to the patient.  Written informed consent was obtained.  Lidocaine
     1% was used as local anesthesia and was injected into the subcutaneous soft
     tissues overlying the right lower hemithorax.  The area over the right
     hemithorax was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A pre-
     procedure timeout was called to confirm the patient's identity and the type of
     procedure to be performed.  A 15-gauge needle was inserted into the right
     hemithorax in an effort to perform a thoracentesis.  It became clear that
     there was no fluid in the right pleural space but rather a solid lesion. Three
     core biopsies of the lesion were obtained.  The patient tolerated the
     procedure satisfactorily.  There were no immediate complications. Post-
     procedure, the fluoroscopy images demonstrate no pneumothorax.
     
     The attending physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5**]. [**First Name (STitle) 3122**], was present throughout the entire
     procedure.
