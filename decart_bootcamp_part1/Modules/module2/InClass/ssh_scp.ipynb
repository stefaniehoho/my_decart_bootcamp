    "SSH stands for **s**ecure **tsh**ll. ssh is a protocol that was developed in the 1990s to replace older remote connection protocols like [``telnet``](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet). ``ssh`` uses [public key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) to encrypt the transmissions across the connection. This is important when passwords are being passed for authentication. ``telnet`` and ``ftp`` do not use encryption, so passwords are being passed across the network as free text, which can be easily intercepted. There is now a secure ftp (``sftp``) that encrypts the communication. \n",
